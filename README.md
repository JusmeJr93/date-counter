#  Date Counter App

This Date Counter App is a simple yet interactive application that demonstrates the use of React's state management (useState Hook) and event handling. 
Users can increment or decrement a counter by a specified "step" value, which is also adjustable. 
This project is built with React and CSS, and it's an excellent starting point for learning React application development.

## Features

- **Adjustable Counting Steps:** Choose the increment/decrement step size for the counter.
- **Flexible Counting:** Increase or decrease the main count based on the current step.
- **Date Calculation:** Displays how many days from today (future or past) based on the count.
